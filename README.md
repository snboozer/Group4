Project Description:

Our application allows the user to quickly find local events and nearby restaurants, so that they can plan an evening out based on their mood.

This app utilizes javascript and jQuery to run on one page with dynamically created elements and retrieve data from API's.

It is constructed on a lightweight css framework called skeleton for ease of mobile implementation and also utilizes moment.js.

APIs:
Ticket Master
Zomato
